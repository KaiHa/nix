Recommends: nix-setup-systemd
Description: Purely functional package manager (binaries)
 A powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that
 makes package management reliable and reproducible. Nix provides
 atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple
 versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup
 of build environments.
 .
 NOTE: This package only provides the nix binaries. One still needs
 to setup directories, environments variables and configuration files
 to use nix as described in the nix manual.
 The package nix-setup-systemd provides such a setup using systemd
 mechanisms.

 NOTE: This package creates (via tmpfiles.d) a top-level folder /nix.
